# Comparative Study of the Quantum Key Distribution Protocol in Noisy Environment.

# ABSTRACT: 
Communication at present is rooted deeply in the concept of bits of zeros and
ones which originated from Shannon’s Theory of Information. Everything in today’s
digital world from advanced notebooks, to mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches,
and laptops are all entrenched in classical communication techniques of zeros and
ones. The security in this classical era is perfectly attained by harnessing the prop-
erties of primes, exploiting them through the mathematical structures of fields, and
groups, or by using topological structures. The most popular and widely used clas-
sical cryptosystem, RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) is based on the mathemati-
cal hardness of prime factorization of the product of two large prime by any of
the present classical processors. But the advancement in technology particularly in
Quantum Information provides a threat to the present communication protocols. It
motivates the researchers to move to new technologies that are fundamentally more
secure through the principle of Quantum Mechanics. The search for Quantum Com-
munication guarded by Quantum Cryptographic Protocols provides uncompromised
security. Such protocols rely upon Qubits, quantum analogous to Bits for data trans-
missions. These qubits are quite sensible and thus any attempt to measure them by
attackers left them to be disturbed and detectable by the legitimate users. But
the Quantum Communication Protocols are prone to noise, being too much sensible
their states are easily damaged by external factors. Besides the circuit noises Bit
and Phase flipping there are other categories of noise. Depolarization, Amplitude
Damping, Decoherence, Thermal Relaxation, and Phase Damping are obstacles to
achieving long-distance communication. The dissertation focuses on the comparative
study of Quantum Communication Protocols in a noisy environment and concludes
with the robustness of protocols concerning different classes of noise.
